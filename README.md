# LaTeX macros for Fitch style natural deduction

Fitch-style natural deduction is a system for writing proofs in
propositional logic and predicate logic. We use it in our logic courses
at the University of Ottawa. This is a set of easy-to-use LaTeX macros
that I wrote for making handouts for my classes.

With these macros, one can typeset natural deduction proofs in Fitch
style, as in the following example:

![](fitchexample.png){border="0"}

```
\begin{nd}
  \hypo {1} {\forall y \neg P(y)}
  \open          
    \hypo {2} {\exists x P(x)}
    \open[u]       
      \hypo {3} {P(u)}
      \have {4}{\forall y \neg P(y)}  \r{1}
      \have {5} {\neg P(u)}           \Ae{4}
      \have {6} {\bot}                \ne{3,5}
    \close
    \have {6a} {\bot}                 \Ee{2,3-6}
  \close
  \have {7} {\neg \exists x P(x)}     \ni{2-6a}
\end{nd}         
```

The output is shown above, and the corresponding LaTeX code below.
