LaTeX macros for Fitch style natural deduction

## Usage

Fitch-style natural deduction is a system for writing proofs in
propositional logic and predicate logic. This is a set of easy-to-use
LaTeX macros originally written by Peter Selinger. It is used, e.g.,
in the various versions of _forall x_ by PD Magnus (e.g., the
[original](https://www.fecundity.com/logic/download.html),
[Cambridge](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytbu/OERs.html), and
[Calgary](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org) versions)

With these macros, one can typeset natural deduction proofs in Fitch
style, as in the following example:

![](fitchexample.png)

```
\begin{nd}
  \hypo {1} {\forall y \neg P(y)}
  \open          
    \hypo {2} {\exists x P(x)}
    \open[u]       
      \hypo {3} {P(u)}
      \have {4}{\forall y \neg P(y)}  \r{1}
      \have {5} {\neg P(u)}           \Ae{4}
      \have {6} {\bot}                \ne{3,5}
    \close
    \have {6a} {\bot}                 \Ee{2,3-6}
  \close
  \have {7} {\neg \exists x P(x)}     \ni{2-6a}
\end{nd}         
```

The output is shown above, and the corresponding LaTeX code below.

## Changes

**v0.6, Sept 4, 2023.** Updated the documentation and license (from
GPL to LPPL). The code is essentially unchanged.

**v0.5, Feb 8, 2005.** The ability to handle multi-line formulas
was added.
